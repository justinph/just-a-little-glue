	<h1>About glue</h1>
	<p>Just a little glue is a very simple page management package. It was created to allow those with basic html knowledge and ftp access on a shared server to make changes to a site's content, but not change the site design. It is designed to be low maintenance and not require database access or fancy setup.</p>
